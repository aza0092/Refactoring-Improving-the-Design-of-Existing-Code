# Replace Nested Conditional with Guard Clauses


## Motivation:
- A guard clause is a type of if-else check where one leg is normal and the other is an unusual condition
- The strategy here is to do something and get out via 'return' statements


## Mechanics:
- Select outermost condition that needs to be replaced, and change it into a guard clause, return statements
- Repeat as needed
